# PRODIGY_DS_02
OVERVIEW:

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore relationships between variables, identify patterns, and uncover trends in the data. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides information on passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographics and survival status.

PROJECT GOALS:

Perform data cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the Titanic dataset.
Explore relationships between variables such as passenger class, age, gender, and survival.
Visualize data patterns and trends using charts and graphs.
Draw conclusions and provide insights based on the analysis.

DATASET:

The dataset consists of the following files:

gender_submission.csv: Contains passenger IDs and predicted survival outcomes for the test set.
Other files such as train.csv and test.csv may also be included in the repository.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Python
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization
Google Collab: Interactive data exploration and analysis

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

-Incorporate machine learning models to predict survival outcomes based on passenger attributes.
-Compare different feature engineering techniques and model performance.
-Expand analysis to include additional datasets or related historical context.
